# VolpesBot
 Chat bot for twitch.tv written in [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/).

Needs a [Twitch Chat OAuth token](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) inside the twitchoauth.txt file in the .../Files directory.

This software uses a modified version of [MyRC](https://github.com/G33kDude/MyRC) - see MyRC-LICENSE - and [Socket.ahk](https://github.com/G33kDude/Socket.ahk)

Also uses [SendMessage.ahk](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/77796-senddata-sending-data-between-scripts-with-sendmessage/) to make it and easy to communicate with other ahk scripts.
